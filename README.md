# paralllelandclustercomputing
Here are examples of parallel and cluster programming I created during my final year of University.
Each of the Assign x folders explore matrix multiplication algorithms executed with different multi threading libraries.
Included are screen shots comparing the performance of each algorithm / tehcnique / library.

Bash scripts were employed were appropriate to automate testing performance of the different programs.

Keep in mind some of these programs were designed to run on clustered computers and may take some tinkering to get to work.
