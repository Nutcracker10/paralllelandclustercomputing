# paralllelandclustercomputing
Here are examples of parallel and cluster programming I created during my final year of University.
Each of the Assign x folders explore matrix multiplication algorithms executed with different multi threading libraries.
Included are screen shots comparing the performance of each algorithm / tehcnique / library.

Keep in mind some of these programs were designed to run on clustered computers and may take some tinkering to get to work.
